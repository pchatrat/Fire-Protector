Fire Probability Detection with Computer Vision

Introduction:

Wildfires have posed a significant risk to both human life and the environment. Early detection and prompt response have become more crucial for minimizing the damage caused by the fire. According to Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service dataset in 2023 , the wildfire emissions is estimated to be 2170 Megatons of carbon. The last recorded emission was in 2022 , at 1455 Megatons of carbon.

Summary: In my project here, I worked with two different models: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and EfficientNetB0 model in order to solve the fire detection problem. I have tried to compare the results towards the end of the experiment.

Note:-
You will require T4 GPU compute capability to run my code.
